This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript bug involving type guards and unhandled types. The `processValue` function uses type guards to check if a value is a number or a string, but fails to handle boolean types, resulting in the 'Type not supported' message. The solution demonstrates how to properly handle the boolean type, either by adding an explicit check or by throwing a more descriptive error.
